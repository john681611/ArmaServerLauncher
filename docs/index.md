# ArmA Server Manager

----
## Installation
 App is generally standalone .exe with caveats on desktop:
 1. Desktop version requires [WebView2 Runtime](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=2124703) this may not be installed on windows by default. If Web Exe works and Desktop doesn't this is likely the issue.
 1. Desktop won't run if placed within `Program Files` or `Program Files (x86)` (Its a Microsoft issue not us :D)
